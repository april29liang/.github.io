## Work Experience

- **Mar. 2021 - Jun.2021** Urban Planner at [[Shanghai One-tenth Art Company](https://www.onetenth.cn/en/home/)]
  <br>
  Engaged in the Waterfront Area Planning Project in Longquan City as a core team member[[Project Info](https://www.onetenth.cn/en/cities/p_f992b662a4c3d36c3a92f7c7bd14cbd2)]. Discovered local cultural spaces, applied the cultural landscape theory and spatial analysis in the local culture revitalization, and carried out architecture programming of 10 future public waterfront venues.
- **Aug. 2020 - Mar.2021** Urban Planner at [[Shanghai TIANHUA Urban Planning and Design Co., Ltd](https://www.thape.com/?locale=en)]
  <br>
  Responsible for several urban planning projects:Chengdu Beihu Bamboo Industry Area Planning Project[[Project Info](https://www.thape.com/works/60)], Suzhou Lujia Subway Station TOD Project, Zhangzhou Longhai Fishery Port and Industry Area Planning Project, Hainan Lingao yacht port and yacht industry area Planning Project.

## Research Experience

- **Effects of home and workplace built environments on park usage: A case study of Shanghai** 09/2019-06/2020
  <br>
Geocoded addresses of each individualâ€™s home and workplace and calculated their shortest distances; Collected and processed park usage frequency, social-economic data and health information. Quantified built environment factors (e.g., mixed land-use index, street cross density) based on POI (Point of Interest) data mining. Implemented a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model to analyze the non-linear impact of urban built environment on park usage frequency
