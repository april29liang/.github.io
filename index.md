## About Me
Currently, I am a member of the Smart and Sustainable Cities Study Group (ITU-T SG20) at the International Telecommunication Union headquarters in Geneva. Here, I examine sustainable development trends of urban digital transformation from the perspectives of international organizations, cities, and businesses. I recently completed my Master's degree in Regional Planning at Cornell University in 2023 May.
<br>
Smart Cities, urban sustainability and transportation are my focuses of study and research. Like many other domains, they have been dramatically influenced by AI and data science. With the question about what a data-driven sustainability study should be, I chose an interdisciplinary curriculum in the intersection of machine learning, urban economics, cultural geography, GIScience, etc. Therefore, I have acquired a strong technical skillset in Natural Language Processing, heterogeneous data integration, spatial statistics, etc., and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch. Additionally, I have carried out a wide variety of independent research projects, such as applying spatially explicit Boosted Tree models to study how urban environment influences people’s choices in sustainable transportation and green space usage. 
<br>
I also have rich practical experience as an urban planner for 2 years totally. I used to make detailed market analyses for different industries, conduct case studies, and provide viable consulting solutions for local economic development. During these practical experiences, I often communicated with government officials and private sector clients.
